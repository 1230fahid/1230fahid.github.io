                        My journey began when I started to attend <span style={{

                        }}>Drexel</span> <span style={{
                            color: 'rgb(109,148,221)'
                        }}>University</span> as an undergrad 
                        back in September, 2019. 
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        There I switched majors multiple times from Electrical 
                        Engineering to Computer Engineering to Computer Science. During my time there, I 
                        developed many technical and soft skills, made amazing connections, and gained 
                        professional experience, which have all shaped me into the man I am today.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        Currently I am still deciding what it is I still want to do in the future. On one end,
                        I would like to pursue a Master's degree in order to become a data scientist. However, 
                        I enjoy full-stack development quite a bit and seek to keep working in this field for 
                        the next few years.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        In my free time, I love to go to the gym and stay in shape by lifting weights and running a bit.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        I've also been invested into books and I plan to read Don Quixote and the Epic of Gilgamesh next.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        I also want to learn how to bake to make tasty deserts that are low-calorie and filling.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        Also a HUGE fan of anime! Especially classic 80's and 90's ones!
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        Overall, I'm really glad to be a part of the realm of Computer Science and am 
                        thankful for all of the people I've met and am just looking forward to do fun 
                        things tomorrow!
